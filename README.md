## ðŸ›  What This Script Does (`New-AzServerVmRdp-20250509_GitHub.ps1`)

- Creates a resource group (`MyTestRG`)
- Builds a VNet, Subnet, and NSG (with RDP rule)
- Creates a NIC and Public IP
- Deploys a Windows Server 2022 VM with RDP enabled
- Prompts you for admin credentials
- Outputs the assigned public IP for RDP access

## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. Open PowerShell and authenticate:

```powershell
Connect-AzAccount
Set-AzContext -SubscriptionId "<your-subscription-id>"
```

2. Save and run the script:

```powershell
.\New-AzServerVmRdp-20250509_GitHub.ps1
```

3. Use the public IP and your credentials to RDP into the VM.

## ðŸ§¹ How to Clean Up (`Remove-AzServerVmRdp-20250509_GitHub.ps1`)

To avoid charges for unused resources (disk, IP, NIC, etc.), delete the resource group after testing:

```powershell
Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name "MyTestRG" -Force -AsJob
```

This removes:
- The VM (`MyServerVM`)
- Public IP (`MyPublicIP`)
- NIC (`MyNIC`)
- NSG (`MyNSG`)
- VNet + Subnet (`MyVNet`, `MySubnet`)
- Managed Disk
- And anything else in `"MyTestRG"`
